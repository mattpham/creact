# Creact

## What is this?

This a project I am using to experiment with React and things related to React. Its a dirty playground of sorts, so things may be out of place.

Its a web app that lets you create data tables and update their entries. So, its basically a CRUD app that is stored in memory at the moment. Essentially the idea is that there is a middleware "database" that allows a user to create a "schema" for the table they will interact with.

## Stuff

Things that I plan to mess around with or use in this project:

- [x] React
- [-] React Router
- [ ] Redux
- [ ] Apollo and GraphQL
- [ ] PostgreSQL
